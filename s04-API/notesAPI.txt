API stands for Application Programming Interface
- An API is the part of the server responsible for receiving request and sending response. It is also the one responsible for handling your routes and the proper response

Rest API
- REpresentational State Transer. It is an architectural style for communication between application

What problem does it solve?
	The need to separate user interface concerns of the client fro mthe dtaa storage concerns of the server

	Enables a decoupled server which can understand, process and respond to clinet requests without knowing the client state

In REST, our requests has all of the information thaat the server needs from our client
	
	A REST API request:
		It is usually dictated by the HTTP method. Through an HTTP method, the action needed to be done is determined. 
		A request containes additional information about the request: Headers
		A body which contains data that needs to be sent to a server
		We can operate and access resources through URL patch
	In a REST API, all the server needs from the client is already in the request and all client needs from the server is in the response

Postman
- It is a testing tool to test APIE endpoint and routes. It is a client with which we can create requests from and receive our server/api's.
